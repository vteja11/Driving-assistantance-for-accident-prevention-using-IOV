Vehicle to Vehicle Communication (V2V): V2V is a technology which enables the vehicles to communicate with each other. 
 Vehicle to Infrastructure Communication(V2I): Vehicle to-infrastructure communications is the wireless exchange of data between vehicles and highway infrastructure.
    In this phase vehicle to infrastructure communication is simulated where, the vehicle and decision server communicate with each other for providing the traffic, accidental information over highways 
    This is a communication infrastructure used to support the route information during traffic over highway. Therefore using the hybrid of V2V, V2I & V2R creates an effective accidental prevention system. 
    The major part of the proposed system utilizes the following devices:
 Vehicle to Road Side Unit (V2R): In V2R communication, Road Side Units (RSUs) keep the data of moving nodes i.e. vehicle like speed, distance from RSU, and route information of vehicles.

Decision server: That is additional functional server which collects information from RSU nodes about the traffic (if the nodes are under load condition then power consumption in node is high).
RSU: Road side unit (RSU) devices are working as Wi-Fi or access point for vehicle nodes and for similar nodes (other RSU) these devices are working as connected link nodes. 
These RSUs are connected using a backbone bus and in direct communication with the server.
Vehicle: These are MANET fully functional devices which are able to send and receive data from other devices and also behave as router node.
